## About Me
Raised in Chile, moved to Spain as a teenager seeking to broaden my horizons. Starting a journey that‚Äôs now spanned over a decade, taking me across multiple European cities. Currently in Barcelona, automating processes and planning last-mile logistics through carefully designed arquitectures with the goal of simplyfying redudancies and ultimately saving time. A long side my work, you will find me building next generation webUIs and exploring web automation techniques to streamline data-driven workflows. Away from the keyboard, I find balance through the art of magic‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs with a deck of cards, close-up illusions, or stage performances. It‚Äôs my creative outlet, a way to stay grounded.
